"MICROWAVE!!!
Important information for folks (Ladies & Gents) Using Microwave In House Or At Office….???
Pls Read It Carefully & Not Miss Out Any Points.



     


When was the last time you checked your microwave for radiation leakage?
Yes, I did say radiation leakage, because any microwave can start leaking radiation any time, for whatever reasons. And such a
leakage is hazardous to humans and pets in the house.
You don’t need to call in experts or to send your microwave to the dealer’s workshop for a leakage test. That’s time consuming,
inconvenient and costly.
Here’s how you can test your microwave for
radiation leakage, right in your own house, at no cost.
Just follow these simple steps >>>
1. Switch-off and un-plug the microwave from the electrical socket.
2. Place your mobile phone inside the microwave and shut the door.
3. Using another mobile phone, dial the phone that’s inside the microwave.
4. If the outside phone says “the number you are dialling is not reachable, or is out of coverage area, or is switched off; then your
microwave is safe.
5. But if the phone inside the microwave lights up and rings, your microwave is leaking radiation. Just throw away the damn thing and get a new one. (Believe me, the medical treatment of the side-effects of radiation leaks is costlier than the price of maybe 10 new microwaves.)
Remember, just because the door of your microwave appears to shut properly does not conclusively mean that it is not leaking radiation.
Stay safe, and test your microwave regularly at frequent intervals; the frequency of testing depending on the extent of usage, and you are the best judge of that.

"A 24-year-old female tourist from Germany has reportedly given birth to a litter of German Shepherd puppies in Stellenbosch, Western Cape Province in South Africa, after being hospitalized with severe stomach pains.
Doctors at a Western Cape private hospital were surprised to see Kedder go into labor, as she didn’t know she was pregnant.



     


“It was even more of a shock when three tiny puppies came out instead of a baby,” said Dr. Brown of the Medical Center where Kedder gave birth to her ‘puppies’.
“To be honest, we didn’t know this was possible. It’s both a marvel of modern medicine and extremely disturbing at the same time.”
Kedder admits that while she was recently living at home, she would often have sex with the family dog, Jonsey, because she couldn’t find a date.
It all started when my parents moved to a new place while we were still based in Germany. I lost my job, and my boyfriend dumped me too,” said Kedder. “I didn’t have time to meet any new guys while I was applying for jobs, so I would sometimes have sex with Jonsey our dog, just to relieve myself of too much stress. I don’t think it was wrong. He’s a big dog, and he wasn’t hurt by it. In fact, he really seemed to like it. I know I did. And besides, back in our country having sex with an animal is not a crime, and I don’t giving birth to an animal would either be a crime here provided the act wasn’t committed in this country,” she said.
According to Dr. Brown, Kedder’s birth is the first on record for an inter-species relationship.

"So beautiful. Cannot resist not to share.
TRUE STORY…PLEASE DO NOT DELETE, RETURN IF YOU CAN’T FORWARD TO AT LEAST ONE PERSON!!!
At the prodding of my friends I am writing this story. My name is Mildred Honor. I am a former elementary school Music Teacher from Des Moines, Iowa.



     


I have always supplemented my income by Teaching Piano Lessons…Something I have done for over 30 years. During those years, I found that Children have many levels of musical ability, and even though I have never had the prodigy, I have taught some very talented students. However, I have also had my share of what I call ‘Musically Challenged Pupils.
One such Pupil being Robby. Robby was 11 years old when his Mother (a Single Mom) dropped him off for his first Piano Lesson.
I prefer that Students (especially Boys) begin at an earlier age, which I explained to Robby. But Robby said that it had always been his Mother’s Dream to hear him play the Piano, so I took him as a Student.
At the end of each weekly Lesson he would always say ‘My Mom’s going to hear me Play someday.’ But to me, it seemed hopeless, he just did not have any Inborn Ability.I only knew his Mother from a distance as she dropped Robby off or waited in her aged Car to pick him up. She always waved and smiled, but never dropped in;
Then one day Robby stopped coming for his Lessons. I thought about calling him, but Assumed that because of his lack of Ability he had decided to pursue something else. I was also glad that he had stopped coming. He was a Bad Advertisement for my Teaching!
Several Weeks later I mailed a flyer recital to the Students’ homes. To my surprise, Robby (who had received a flyer) asked if he could be in the Recital. I told him that the Recital was for current Pupils and that because he had dropped out, he really did not Qualify.
He told me that his Mother had been Sick and Unable to take him to his piano lessons, but that he had been practicing. ‘Please Miss Honor, I’ve just got to Play,’ he insisted. I don’t know what led me to allow him to play in the Recital – perhaps it was his insistence or maybe something inside of me saying that it would be all right;
The night of the Recital came and the high school gymnasium was packed with Parents, Relatives and Friends. I put Robby last in the Program, just before I was to come up and thank all the Students and Play a finishing piece. I thought that any damage he might do would come at the end of the Program and I could always salvage his poor performance through my ‘Curtain Closer’.
Well, the Recital went off without a Hitch, the Students had been Practicing and it Showed. Then Robby came up on the stage. His Clothes were Wrinkled and his Hair looked as though he had run an egg beater through it. ‘Why wasn’t he dressed up like the other Students?’ I thought. ‘Why didn’t his Mother at least make him Comb his Hair for this Special Night?’
Robby pulled out the Piano bench, and I was Surprised when he announced that he had chosen to play Mozart’s Concerto No.21 in C Major. I was not prepared for what I heard next. His fingers were light on the keys, they even danced nimbly on the Ivories. He went from Pianissimo to Fortissimo, from Allegro to Virtuoso; his Suspended Chords that Mozart demands were Magnificent! Never had I heard Mozart played so well by anyone his age.
After six and a half minutes, he ended in a Grand Crescendo, and everyone was on their feet in Wild Applause!!! Overcome and in Tears, I ran up on stage and put my arms around Robby in Joy;
‘I have never heard you Play like that Robby, how did you do it?’ Through the Microphone Robby explained: ‘Well, Miss Honor, Remember I told you that my Mom was sick? Well, she actually had Cancer and Passed Away this Morning. And well… she was Born Deaf, so tonight was the first time she had ever heard me Play, and I wanted to make it Special.,
There wasn’t a Dry Eye in the house that evening. As People from Social Services led Robby from the stage to be placed in to Foster Care, I noticed that even their Eyes were red and Puffy. I thought to myself then how much Richer my Life had been for taking Robby as my Pupil.
No, I have never had a Prodigy, but that night I became a Prodigy… of Robby. He was the Teacher and I was the Pupil, for he had taught me the meaning of Perseverance and Love and Believing in Yourself, and may be even taking a chance on someone and you didn’t know why.
Robby was Killed years later in the Senseless Bombing of the Alfred P. Murray Federal Building in Oklahoma City in April, 1995.

CAR THIEVES GONE DIGITAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ""I locked my car. As I walked away I heard my car door unlock’'. I went back and locked my car again three times. Each time, as soon as I started to walk away, I could hear it unlock again!! Naturally alarmed, I looked around and there were two men sitting in a car next to the Store. They were obviously watching me intently, and there seemed no doubt they were somehow involved in this very weird situation. I quickly abandoned my errand, jumped into my car and sped away. I went straight to the police station, told them what had happened, and found out I was part of a new, and very successful, scheme being used to gain entry into parked cars. Two weeks later, my friend's son had a similar experience....While traveling, he stopped at a motorway service area to use the toilet. When he came out to his car less than 5 minutes later, someone had managed to get into his car and had stolen his mobile phone, laptop computer, sat-nav, briefcase and other belongings. He called the police and since there were no signs of his car having been broken into, the police told him he had probably been a victim of the latest robbery tactic – there is a device that robbers are using now to clone your security code when you lock your doors on your car using your remote locking device. They sit a distance away and watch for their next victim. They know you are going inside the Store, restaurant, or whatever and that they now have a few minutes to steal and run. * The police officer said always to lock your car manually with the key when parking in a public area. That way if there is someone sitting in a car nearby watching for their next victim, it will not be you. When you lock up with the key upon exiting, it does not send the security code, but if you walk away and use the remote button, it sends the code through the airwaves where it can be easily intercepted by the device. This is very real. Be aware of what you just read and please pass this information on. Look how many times we all lock our doors with our remote just to be sure we remembered to lock them -- and bingo, someone has our code...and potentially whatever is in our car.” Please share with everyone you know in the hope that we can frustrate these thieves. PLEASE , PLEASE AND PLEASE  Lock your car with the key manually NOT  with the remote control HENCEFORTH.

Hi All. Please share this information with your family, friends and clients. VIN NUMBER - WARNING! So simple, I would have NEVER thought about someone doing that!!!! Here is INFO worth the price of your car.... WHAT WILL the car thieves THINK OF NEXT? The car thieves peer through the windshield of your car or vehicle, write down the VIN# from the label on the dash, go to the local car dealership and request a duplicate key based on the VIN# I didn't believe this e-mail, so I called Chrysler-Dodge, GM & Ford and pretended I had lost my keys. They told me to just bring in the VIN#, and they would cut me one on the spot, and I could order the keyless device if I wanted. The Car Dealer's Parts Department will make a duplicate key from the VIN #, and collect payment from the thief who will return to your vehicle. He doesn't have to break in, do any damage to the vehicle, or draw attention to himself. All he has to do is walk up to your car, insert the key and off he goes to a local chop shop with your vehicle. You don't believe it? It IS that EASY. To avoid this from happening to you, simply put some dark tape (electrical tape, duct tape or medical tape) across the VIN Number Metal Label located on the dashboard. By law, you cannot remove the VIN, but you CAN cover it so it can't be viewed through the windshield by a car thief. I urge you to forward this to your friends before some other car thief steals another car or truck. I slipped a 3x5 card over my VIN NUMBER. PASS THIS INFO ON TO YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS NOW!!!!! Luv u all................... Take care

Aneurysm awareness: Another victim of aneuryms just passed away today, Isabel Granada, 41, a movie actress in the Philippines. The co-teacher of my classmate who suffered Aneu late last year & she undergo brain surgery & fortunately thru God's miracle she was able to recover. Prior to the case of my classmate’s coteacher, the cousin of my classmate’s husband's also suffered aneurysm, comatose for months in a hosp & also recovered. Anyone can be a victim of the sudden attack of our brain. But theres a proven technique how to avoid it. When taking a bath, do not start pouring water on your head.This is a bad practice. Blood temperature will shoot up because of the cold water, instead wet your feet first or lower extremeties, then wait for a few seconds & You can feel a fussing temperature inside you. Then slowly wetting your upper extremeties. It means to say taking bath from feet to head NOT head down will save YOU from aneuysm attack. You may share this also to friends!!!Life is precious.❤

HOW TO TRACE A MISSING OR STOLEN PHONE If you lose your mobile phone, you can trace it without going to the police. Most of us always fear that our phones may be stolen at any time. Each phone carries a unique IMEI no. i.e. International Mobile Equipment Identity No which can be used to track it anywhere in the world. This is how it works: 1. Dial *#06# from your mobile. 2. Your mobile phone shows a unique 15 digit. 3. Note down this number at a secure place except in your mobile phone itself as this is the number which will help trace your phone in case of theft. 4. Once stolen, just E-mail this 15 digit IMEI No. to cop@vsnl.net with details as stated below: Your name:________ Address:________ Phone model:_______ Make:_________ Last used No.:_______ E-mail for communication:___ Missed date:_______ IMEI No :_________ 5.Your Mobile will be traced within next 24 hours via a complex system of GPRS and internet, You will find where your hand set is being operated and the new user's No. will be sent to your email. 6.

Hi guys, Just want to tell you about this crazy thing that happened to a cousin of one of my sisters friends… she was at Brooklyn Mall with her boyfriend and had dinner at Moo Moo’s. She went to the loo opposite the Food Lovers and her boyfriend thought she’d been gone quite long so he went to check on her. When he walked towards the ladies bathroom this Nigerian lady walked out pushing a wheelchair and the person in the wheelchair was slumped over. He noticed the person had the same shoes as his girlfriend so he walked over and pushed the hair out off her face and saw it was his girlfriend. She was drugged and her hair cut and dyed, clothes changed in the Brooklyn toilets! the Nigerian lady ran off. The police say they’re pretty sure they were going to human traffic her. And it’s rampant in SA apparently.

Listen carefully. On the 6th April I need you to be very careful. Book off from work. Tell everybody to stay home. The kids too.The blacks are planning something very big in PTA and JHB and surrounding areas that day. This is not a game. This is not just a story. I’m connected with some very important people and the warnings are going out. Have enough water and food. Get some sort of weapon or two. Put the dog/s inside as well for protection. Don’t leave your house! Start warning friends and family! We believe this to be either a practice run with destruction and death; or the start of the civil war in this country.

Please forward to everyone you know. Afriforum has declared November in memory of those murdered in farm attacks. If they get 100 000 votes, they can hand over a document to the United Nations asking them to intervene against farm murders and farmers being targeted. They will also lodge a complaint with the President due to the SAPS being so lethargic. They already have 4 000 votes, so we still need 96 000. To vote, SMS your name to 45353 to support this initiative. Each phone can only vote once and it costs R1.50 per SMS. Please support this good cause. Thank you.
